      <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
      <p>
        Yoga teachers face challenges in organizing personalized and effective
        class plans for diverse student needs. Managing class content,
        sequencing poses, and tracking plans can be time-consuming and
        error-prone. Existing tools like basic spreadsheets or general
        note-taking apps lack tailored features for yoga class planning.
        Dedicated apps for yoga planning, such as Tummee or Pocket Yoga, offer
        pre-defined sequences but often lack customization, pose management, or
        integration with daily teaching schedules. This lack of flexibility
        hinders teachers' ability to adapt plans to various yoga styles (e.g.,
        Gentle, Flow, Restorative) or skill levels. The gap presents an
        opportunity for a more interactive, user-friendly tool designed
        specifically to address these unique needs. Our project proposes a Yoga
        Class Planner to empower teachers with seamless class creation, pose
        management, and reusability of history poses.

        Here are two example websites dealing with similar problem:

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our target audience would be yoga instructors that want a simple way
        plan classes. Our core features that instructors will be able to use
        would be course management, class builder, and pose history. The UW IMA
        Yoga Teacher Training recommends using a yoga pose card deck to help
        instructors design and schedule their classes. However, the current deck
        includes only one card per pose, limiting its flexibility and making it
        less reusable for varying class structures or repeated use in various
        teaching scenarios. The website will be able to create, delete, modify
        yoga courses. Set start time, name of yoga course, and duration. It will
        also have a feature to allow instructors to input desired pose into the
        class, and the expected duration of each pose. The wesbite will also
        store their data/history for previous inputted yoga poses which allows
        them to select from their pose history to enter into the class builder.
        Instructors may also view all previously used poses.
      </p>

      <h2>Data and technology</h2>
      <p>
        Reference Data: A CSV or API containing common yoga poses (with names,
        durations, and images). Firebase: For persisting class plans and user
        data. React Libraries: For drag-and-drop interactions and responsive
        design. By enabling easy class creation, pose organization, and reusable
        plans, this app reduces the administrative burden for yoga teachers,
        allowing them to focus on teaching. Teachers gain a structured way to
        deliver high-quality, customized experiences for their students,
        promoting better engagement and retention.
