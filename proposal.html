      <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
      <p>
        Yoga teachers face challenges in organizing personalized and effective class plans for diverse student needs. Managing class content, sequencing poses, and tracking plans can be time-consuming and error-prone. Existing tools like basic spreadsheets or general note-taking apps lack tailored features for yoga class planning. Dedicated apps for yoga planning, such as Tummee or Pocket Yoga, offer pre-defined sequences but often lack customization, pose management, or integration with daily teaching schedules. This lack of flexibility hinders teachers' ability to adapt plans to various yoga styles (e.g., Gentle, Flow, Restorative) or skill levels. The gap presents an opportunity for a more interactive, user-friendly tool designed specifically to address these unique needs. Our project proposes a Yoga Class Planner to empower teachers with seamless class creation, pose management, and reusability of history poses.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our target audience would be yoga instructors who want to have an easy and efficient course planning tool.
      </p>

      <h3>Distinct Core Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1. Class Creation and Scheduling: Allow yoga teachers to create classes by inputing details such as class title, date, style (e.g., Gentle, Flow, Restorative), duration, student name, pose names. The created classes will appear in a calendar view where teachers can visualize and edit/delete their weekly or monthly schedule. Inside each class tab, teachers can upload names and images (optional) of poses and make them into an order.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. Class Notes and Timer Integration: Provides an interface for teachers to add real-time class notes and integrate a timer to help manage session flow. How it works: Teachers can add quick notes about adjustments, feedback, or reminders while teaching (e.g., Modify Warrior II for beginners OR Students liked this flow). This page includes a simple timer feature where teachers can set timers for individual segments of the class (e.g., warm-up, main flow, cool down) and track time during the session. The timer is displayed alongside the class note-taking, helping teachers multitask within one web page. This feature combines real-time note-taking with time management, enhancing the teaching experience and making sessions more efficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. Search for Student Profile: The system will automatically save a profile for each new student. Teachers can quickly search and check out what notes they previously left for a student, helping teachers to plan next lesson with personalized class-design.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data and technology</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We will not be using API. It will be completely based on user input data.</li>
          <li>Firebase: For persisting class plans and user data.</li>
          <li>React Libraries: For drag-and-drop interactions and responsive design.</li>
        </ul>
