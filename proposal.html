        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            Yoga teachers face challenges in organizing personalized and effective class plans for diverse student
            needs. Managing class content, sequencing poses, and tracking plans can be time-consuming and error-prone.
            Existing tools like basic spreadsheets or general note-taking apps lack tailored features for yoga class
            planning. Dedicated apps for yoga planning, such as Tummee or Pocket Yoga, offer pre-defined sequences but
            often lack customization, pose management, or integration with daily teaching schedules.

            This lack of flexibility hinders teachers' ability to adapt plans to various yoga styles (e.g., Gentle,
            Flow, Restorative) or skill levels. The gap presents an opportunity for a more interactive, user-friendly
            tool designed specifically to address these unique needs. Our project proposes a Yoga Class Planner to
            empower teachers by offering seamless class creation, pose management, and search capabilities.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            Target Audience: Yoga teachers for planning class for students
        </p>
        <p>
            Core Features (two and a half)
        <ul>
            <li>Create a New Class: </li>
            <li>Course/Pose Management: </li>
            <li>Search & Reuse Plans: </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Data and technology:
            Reference Data: A CSV or API containing common yoga poses (with names, durations, and images).
            Firebase: For persisting class plans and user data.
            React Libraries: For drag-and-drop interactions and responsive design.

            By enabling easy class creation, pose organization, and reusable plans, this app reduces the administrative
            burden for yoga teachers, allowing them to focus on teaching. Teachers gain a structured way to deliver
            high-quality, customized experiences for their students, promoting better engagement and retention.
