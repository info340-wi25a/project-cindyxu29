      <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
      <p>
        Yoga teachers face challenges in organizing personalized and effective class plans for diverse student needs. Managing class content, sequencing poses, and tracking plans can be time-consuming anderror-prone. Existing tools like basic spreadsheets or general note-taking apps lack tailored features for yoga class planning. Dedicated apps for yoga planning, such as Tummee or Pocket Yoga, offer pre-defined sequences but often lack customization, pose management, or integration with daily teaching schedules. This lack of flexibility hinders teachers' ability to adapt plans to various yoga styles (e.g., Gentle, Flow, Restorative) or skill levels. The gap presents an opportunity for a more interactive, user-friendly tool designed specifically to address these unique needs. Our project proposes a Yoga Class Planner to empower teachers with seamless class creation, pose management, and reusability of history poses.

        Here are two example websites dealing with similar problem:
        <a href="https://www.tummee.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=SnrcIVJ&utm_term=tummee&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA-aK8BhCDARIsAL_-H9mLpHiETbUHbubWJhO-mqBhlemD_NxOe9jymOPo9kQ3-IhBCDJLDB4aArexEALw_wcB#tummee-tour-video">Tummee</a>
        and

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our target audience would be yoga instructors that want a simple way plan classes. Our core features that instructors will be able to use would be course management, class builder, and pose history. The UW IMA Yoga Teacher Training recommends using a yoga pose card deck to help instructors design and schedule their classes. However, the current deck includes only one card per pose, limiting its flexibility and making it less reusable for varying class structures or repeated use in various teaching scenarios. The website will be able to create, delete, modify yoga courses. Set start time, name of yoga course, and duration. It will also have a feature to allow instructors to input desired pose into the class, and the expected duration of each pose. The website will also store their data/history for previous inputted yoga poses which allows them to select from their pose history to enter into the class builder. Instructors may also view all previously used poses.
        </p>

        <p>
        The data that the user will utilize will all be user input, as it will allow flexibility regarding pose names and times, creating a planner that is both intuitive for the instructor to use, but also customizable, built around the poses created/input by the instructor. The app will be easy  to use, and accessible through easy to understand UI and a simple drag and drop planner system for their course building. By enabling easy class creation, pose organization, and reusable plans, this app reduces the administrative burden for yoga teachers, allowing them to focus on teaching. Teachers gain a structured way to deliver high-quality, customized experiences for their  students, promoting better engagement and retention.
