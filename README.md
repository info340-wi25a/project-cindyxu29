# YogaEase Interactive Planning Platform

Project Overview: 
YogaEase is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the scheduling and instructional workflows for yoga professionals through a highly interactive, accessible interface. Built with React and Firebase, the platform features a centralized, searchable class library and a dynamic calendar system that leverages real-time data synchronization for seamless schedule management.

Technical implementation focused on a "design-for-all" philosophy, incorporating ARIA attributes, keyboard-only navigation paths, and high-contrast UI components to meet rigorous web accessibility standards. By utilizing asynchronous JavaScript to manage modal-driven forms and personalized user inputs, the system provides a robust, scalable environment for managing health and wellness data. This project demonstrates a successful integration of secure user authentication and database management with highly interactive and accessible user interfaces.


Note: Users need to exist/go back to "My Classes" after adding poses, then they can come back and delete pose one by one successfully.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
